# Climb_-_Examples_of_Stacks
Just stuff I build while learning to use different web stacks. All based on the same application.

## The app - Climb
Based on theCrag (https://www.thecrag.com/).

### Overview
Users and Admins can add rock climbing locations which contain several routes. \
Gyms can add themselves and their routes. \
Users can also log the routes they climbed. \
